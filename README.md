## Overview

Palette Picker is an application that generates random color palettes and gives the user the ability to create projects and save palettes to projects. The Palettes and Projects can then be managed by the user. The random palette generator has functionality to lock each individual color while the others still generate randomly. This adds a layer of customization to the palette creation while still maintaining a random element. 

## SetUp
- Clone Repo down or fork then clone Repo
- In Terminal: cd into directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to create locally hosted server to run app
- App will open in browser
- run `npm test` to see see all tests

## Goals

1. Solidify RESTful API design skills and get familiar with the patterns associated with building a single app across multiple repositories.
2. Server-side testing
3. Further understanding of complete CRUD endpoints
4. Connecting BE & FE repositories using CORS
5. Creating and working within multiple environments:
  - testing
  - making use of automatic continuous integration with TravisCI
  - deployment with Heroku
  
This is the first true full stack project where we are building the back-end and front-end functionality of an app from the ground up. Gaining vital experience in how database design and management is a key factor in developing a front-end, and by working on both at the same time we developed a greater sense of developer empathy and a greater overall understanding of all aspects of web development.

## Front End Tech Stack
HTML5 | CSS3 | SASS/Scss | React.js | React Hooks | Redux | Fetch API | Jest/Enzyme | React-Testing-Library | Javascript ES6 | Node.js
